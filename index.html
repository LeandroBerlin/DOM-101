				<h2>The DOM</h2>
				<p>
					"The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML
					documents. </p>
				It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated."
				</p>
				<p>
					<small>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/introduction.html">W3C Documentation</a>
					</small>
				</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Standardization</h2>
					<p>The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium, which last
						developed a recommendation in 2004.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>A brief history of the DOM</h2>
					<p>The history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the "browser wars" of
						the late 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, as well as with that
						of JavaScript and JScript, the first scripting languages to be widely implemented in the
						JavaScript engines of web browsers.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Browser War</h2>
					<p>The browser war was competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "First
						Browser
						War" during the late 1990s pitted Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator.

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						JavaScript was released by Netscape Communications in 1995 within Netscape Navigator 2.0.
						Netscape's
						competitor, Microsoft, released Internet Explorer 3.0 the following year with a reimplementation
						of
						JavaScript called JScript. JavaScript and JScript let web developers create web pages with
						client-side interactivity.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The limited facilities for detecting user-generated events and modifying the HTML document in the
						first generation of these languages eventually became known as "DOM Level 0" or "Legacy DOM".
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In 1997, Netscape and Microsoft released version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer
						respectively, adding support for Dynamic HTML (DHTML) functionality enabling changes to a loaded
						HTML document.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>After the standardization of ECMAScript, the W3C DOM Working Group began drafting a standard DOM
						specification. The completed specification, known as "DOM Level 1", became a W3C Recommendation
						in late 1998.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled
						browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6 (from 2001), Opera, Safari and
						Gecko-based browsers (like Mozilla, Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).</p>

					<h2>The Dom and Javascript</h2>
					<p>
						"The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by
						representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory.
						Usually
						that means JavaScript, although modelling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects is not part of
						the
						JavaScript language, as such."

					<h2>Javascript Engine</h2>
					<p>
						A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript (JS) code. The first
						JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines utilize just-in-time
						compilation for improved performance.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>JS Browser Engine</h2>
					<p>
						JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has
						one.</p>
					<p>
						In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document
						Object Model.
					</p>
					<p>
						The use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers. For example, the Chrome V8 engine is a
						core component of the popular Node.js runtime system.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>V8 from Google is the most used JavaScript engine (Google Chrome and
							Chromium-based browsers, Electron, Node.js runtime system)</li>
						<li>SpiderMonkey is developed by Mozilla for use in Firefox and its forks. The GNOME Shell uses
							it for extension support.</li>
						<li>Chakra is the current engine of the Microsoft Edge browser, forked from the same-named
							engine of Internet Explorer. However, Microsoft is now rebuilding Edge as a Chromium-based
							browser. Internet Explorer continues to
							use its version of Chakra.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScriptCore is Apple's engine for its Safari browser. Other WebKit-based browsers also
							use
							it. KJS from KDE was the starting point for its development.</li>
						<li>Facebook created the Hermes engine for Android apps using the React Native framework.</li>
						<li>QuickJS is a small and easily embeddable engine created by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie
							Gordon</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Dom: Tree, nodes, objects</h2>
				<p>
					The DOM represents a <b>document</b> with a logical tree.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Each branch of the tree ends in a <b>Node</b></li>
					<li>Each <b>Node</b> contains <b>Objects</b></li>
					<li>HTML elements as Objects</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>
					Lets visualize it!
				</h2>

				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>DOM Document</h2>
				<p>The DOM Document is the owner of all other objects in your webpage. That means if you want to access
					any object on your webpage you always have to start with the document. It also contains many
					important properties and methods that enable us to access and modify our website.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2></h2>
				<p>With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>JS can change all the HTML elements in the page</li>
					<li>JS can change all the HTML attributes in the page</li>
					<li>JS can change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
					<li>JS can remove existing HTML elements/attributes</li>
					<li>JS can add new HTML elements/attributes</li>
					<li>JS can react to all existing HTML events in the page</li>
					<li>JS can create new HTML events in the page</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Methods and Events</h2>
				<p>
					DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change
					the document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them;
					once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Host Environment</h2>
				<p>The JavaScript language was initially created to be used for web browsers. Since then it has evolved
					and become a language with many uses and platforms.</p>
				<p>A platform may be a browser, or a web-server or another host, even a coffee machine. Each of them
					provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification calls that a host
					environment.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>

					A host environment provides own objects and functions additional to the language core. Web browsers
					give a means to control web pages. Node.js provides server-side features, and so on.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>DOM & BOM</h2>
				<p>The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to talk to the browser about matters other than the
					content of the page.</p>
				<p>The <b>window</b> object is the very root element, everything else is attached to it either directly
					or
					indirectly. Hence there’s no need to reference it explicitly.</p>
